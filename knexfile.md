Here is a possible Mermaid Markdown overview for the Go file you provided:
```mermaid
graph LR
  development[development] --> module.exports
  development --> client:mysql2
  development --> connection:DATABASE_URL
  development --> migrations:__dirname+"/migrations"
  development --> seeds:__dirname+"/seeds"
  development --> module.exports

```
This overview uses the `graph` and `-->` syntax to represent the relationships between the different components of the Go file. The `graph` keyword is used to define a directed graph, where each node represents a component (e.g. `development`) and the edges represent the relationships between them.
The `development` node is the root of the graph, and it has several edges leading to other nodes. The `client` edge points to `mysql2`, indicating that the `development` environment uses `mysql2` as the client for database interactions. The `connection` edge points to `DATABASE_URL`, indicating that the `development` environment uses a URL to connect to the database. The `migrations` edge points to `__dirname+"/migrations`, indicating that
