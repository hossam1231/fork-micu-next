When a user successfully logs in to mosque.icu via our.mosque.icu/login, the system initiates a comprehensive authentication process. This involves cross-referencing the user's credentials with the member list to determine their specific role and organizational affiliation.

If the system identifies an existing affiliation, the user is seamlessly directed to mosque.icu/dashboard. Here, they gain access to a spectrum of features, including their personal profile information, diverse mosque-related functionalities, and a hub for pertinent announcements or notifications.

However, in instances where no organizational affiliation is found, the user encounters a tailored experience.
