Here is the Mermaid Markdown overview for the Go file you provided:
```mermaid
graph LR
    A[Go File] --> B[Mermaid Markdown Overview]
    B --> C[Go File]
```
Explanation:

* The `graph LR` directive specifies the diagram layout as a directed graph.
* The `A[Go File]` node represents the starting point of the diagram, which is the Go file.
* The `B[Mermaid Markdown Overview]` node represents the destination point of the diagram, which is the Mermaid Markdown overview of the Go file.
* The `C[Go File]` node represents the connection between the Go file and the Mermaid Markdown overview.
By using Mermaid Markdown, you can easily create diagrams like this one to visualize the relationships between different components of your Go project.
