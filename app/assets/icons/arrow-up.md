Here is the Mermaid Markdown overview for the Go file you provided:
```mermaid
graph LR
  A[Go File] --> B[SVG File]
  A --> C[Mermaid Markdown File]
```
Explanation:

* The `graph LR` directive specifies the diagram layout as a directed graph.
* The `A[Go File]` node represents the Go file that contains the SVG code.
* The `B[SVG File]` node represents the SVG file that is generated from the Go file.
* The `A --> C[Mermaid Markdown File]` edge represents the relationship between the Go file and the Mermaid Markdown file.
Note: The Mermaid Markdown file is generated automatically from the Go file using the `mermaid` tool.
