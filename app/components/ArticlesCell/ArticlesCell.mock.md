```js

// Define your own mock data here:
export const standard = (/* vars, { ctx, req } */) => ({
  articles: [{ id: '42' }, { id: '43' }, { id: '44' }],
})


```

```mermaid

Here is a possible Mermaid Markdown overview for the Go file you provided:
```mermaid
graph LR
  subgraph Go File
    Go File[src]
    +- Define your own mock data here: [standard]
    +- articles: [id: "42", id: "43", id: "44"]
  end
end
```
Note: This is just one possible way to represent the structure of the Go file using Mermaid Markdown. The exact syntax and structure may vary depending on the complexity of the file and the desired level of detail in the overview.
