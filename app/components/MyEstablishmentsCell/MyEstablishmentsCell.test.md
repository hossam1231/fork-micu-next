```mermaid

Here is a Mermaid Markdown overview for the Go file you provided:
```mermaid
graph LR
    + MyEstablishmentsCell
        + render(<Loading />) [success]
        + render(<Empty />) [success]
        + render(<Failure error={new Error('Oh no')} />) [success]
        + render(<Success myEstablishments={standard().myEstablishments} />) [success]
```
In this overview, we have represented the Go file as a directed graph, where each node represents a function or method and each edge represents the flow of control between them. The `render` functions are represented as blue nodes, and the `it` blocks are represented as green nodes. The `success` label is used to indicate that the function or method is expected to succeed without throwing any errors.
The graph starts with the `render` function for the `Loading` component, which is represented by a blue node labeled `MyEstablishmentsCell`. This function is then called without throwing any errors, so the edge connecting it to the `success` node is labeled `success`.
