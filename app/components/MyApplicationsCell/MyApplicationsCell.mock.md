```js

// Define your own mock data here:
export const standard = (/* vars, { ctx, req } */) => ({
  myApplications: [{ id: 42 }, { id: 43 }, { id: 44 }],
})


```

```mermaid

Here is a possible Mermaid Markdown overview for the Go file you provided:
```mermaid
graph LR
  subgraph standard
    standard[myApplications] --> (42)
    standard[myApplications] --> (43)
    standard[myApplications] --> (44)
  end
```
This will generate a simple graph with three nodes representing the `myApplications` array, and three edges connecting them to the corresponding IDs (42, 43, and 44). You can customize the appearance of the graph by adding additional options to the `graph` and `subgraph` directives, such as `node` and `edge` styles.
