```mermaid

Here is the Mermaid Markdown overview for the Go file you provided:
```mermaid
graph LR
  Container[Export *] --> Text[Export *]
```
Explanation:

* `Container`: This represents the container package, which exports all its contents.
* `Text`: This represents the text package, which also exports all its contents.
* `->`: This symbol indicates that the `Container` package exports its contents to the `Text` package.

Note: This is just a simple example, and you can use Mermaid Markdown to create more complex diagrams and visualizations for your Go projects.
