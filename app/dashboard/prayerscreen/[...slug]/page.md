Here is the Mermaid Markdown overview for the Go file you provided:
```mermaid
graph LR
    A[React] --> B[PrayerTimesEditorPage]
    B --> C[page]
    C --> D[export default]
```
Explanation:

* A represents the `React` import.
* B represents the `PrayerTimesEditorPage` component.
* C represents the `page` function.
* D represents the `export default` statement.

Note: In Mermaid Markdown, the arrow symbols (`->`) are used to represent the relationships between the components. The direction of the arrows indicates the direction of the data flow. In this case, the data flows from `React` to `PrayerTimesEditorPage`, and then from `PrayerTimesEditorPage` to `page`.
