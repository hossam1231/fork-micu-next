Pages will undergo processing by examining search parameters, subdomains, and custom URLs. Subsequently, API calls will be made to retrieve the specified data based on these criteria.

```mermaid 

graph TD
  A[User arrives on page] -->|Triggers onload function| B(Determine current URL and subdomain)
  B -->|Make API call| C[Fetch page data based on subdomain]
  C -->|Process and render| D(Render page with retrieved data)


 style A fill:#006600,stroke:#00331a
style B fill:#006633,stroke:#00331a
style C fill:#006633,stroke:#00331a
style D fill:#006633,stroke:#00331a




```



 Upon a user's page arrival, an `onload` function is activated. This function examines the current URL for a subdomain, searching for page data linked to the organization's username. The objective is to enhance page content uniqueness, prioritizing data over design improvements.

```mermaid
classDiagram
  class PageTable {
    + id: random
    + pageId: int
    + Images: []string
    + Iframe: []string
    + H1: []string
    + H2: []string
    + P: []string
    + Template: int
  }

```


This management approach enables efficient and diverse saving of website data. Individual pages will be rendered conditionally based on the specified route, allowing for flexibility in presenting content as per the given conditions.

and is advantageous due to the fact that fetching an array of images for example can render all images in a list of all present on the page

  organization -->|yes| organizationHomepage
  personal -->|yes| personalHomepage
  else -->|no| 404

Once users are part of an organization, members gain access to a suite of tools, empowering them to create and view articles, peruse event timetables, request stewardship of prayers, contribute tickets, and even be assigned maintenance tasks. All these activities contribute to the development of a personal website for each member, enhancing their online presence.

For users operating in organization owner mode, they can navigate to their organization website, mirroring the organization's information onto a website users and organisations alike have the option to add custom domains, tailoring their online presence.

Administrators of mosques hold a distinct set of capabilities, enabling them to create events, manage prayer times, approve articles (this allows the article writers to gain a approved tick on their articles as their group agrees, oversee organization information, handle uploads (iframes) + tag members within those uploads hence them too gaining the upload on their personal site, and add buildings. The building addition process involves submission for approval, with data stored in a MongoDB database and spatially queried to enhance local organization searches.

A unique feature is the perspective incorporated into the mobile app, which extracts relevant data such as local buildings that would gender-specific perspectives. For instance, if there are four nearby buildings, the app could focus on the closest one, housing two organizationsâ€”one catering to males and the other to females.

The spatial query system further refines the user experience by displaying only the most pertinent local organizations at retreiving their data from the sql database. This dynamic approach enhances user engagement with a map and ensures that the platform remains user-centric but affordable.

The process of a user applying for an establishment, submitting documents, and the verification procedure on the admin side:

```mermaid
graph TD
  A[User Applies for Establishment] -->|Submits Documents| B[Admin Receives Documents]
  B -->|Verifies Documents| C[Approval Decision]
  C -->|Approved| D[Notify User: Approval Granted]
  C -->|Rejected| E[Notify User: Approval Denied]
```


# Establishment Application and Verification Process

## Process Overview

1. **User Applies for Establishment:**
   - The user initiates the application process for establishing their entity.

2. **Admin Receives Documents:**
   - The user submits the required documents for verification.
   - The admin receives the documents on the administrative side.

3. **Verification Process:**
   - The admin verifies the submitted documents to ensure they meet the establishment's criteria and any legal requirements.
   - If additional information or corrections are needed, the admin communicates with the user.

4. **Approval Decision:**
   - Based on the verification results, the admin makes a decision regarding approval or rejection of the establishment application.

5. **Notification to User: Approval Granted:**
   - If the documents are approved, the user is notified, and the establishment is granted approval.

6. **Notification to User: Approval Denied:**
   - If the documents are rejected, the user is notified, and the establishment application is denied.

```
Note: This process could be automised heavily as company fraud does exist and is a valid problem companies face its not neccarily our responsibility to shake down our customers

Ps leading to that we can just sift documents for key data such as address ect and store 
```

Now their establishment is confirmed all organizations who claim affiliation can be approved under this entity and become now globally and locally searchable


## Manifesto 2 

Organizations have changed to establishments and also the repo has moved to the old repo and now its a migration to the other side 

EstablishmentID will just superceede Organizations 
and the newly created BuildingID will take on what was formerly known as "a establishment housing multiple organizations"

Website schema will have to change but thats part of the migration

Creating a organization / building formerly known as org and establishment
